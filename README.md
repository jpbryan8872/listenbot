# listenbot
Listenbot is a simple python based Discord bot used to replace the heavy Discord client. It formats and prints messages to the terminal with a customizable user prompt. Create your own application and bot through the Discord developer portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications) to get started.
# Getting Started
1. Install the latest version of Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Download listenbot.py and listenbot.conf and put them in the same folder.
3. Use `pip install discord` and `pip install asyncio` to get the necessary libraries.
4. Configure listenbot.conf to your liking.
5. Run listenbot.py in a terminal to start seeing Discord messages appear!
